        <td>
            The students are given an MDP whose details are not know. It is their task to aproximate the structure of the MDP and then solve it with any method they choose to optain one of the optimal policies.
            They are also expected to generate a policy directly without first constructuing the underlying MDP struture using Q-Leraning. The focus of the assignment is to give the students a non trivial problem to and have them solve it in various methods.

        <th>Audience</th>
        <td>
            Suitable for undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in introductory courses on Artificial Intelligence courses related to reinforcement learning.

        <th>Difficulty</th>
        <td>
            Moderate difficulty for undergraduates with a background in Python programming. The students are expected to solve this assignment with in two weeks.

        <th>Strengths</th>
        <td>
            The assignment is strucutred to give hands on experience with the basics of MDP, RL and Q-Learning, while also providing an opertunity to solve these problem with their own algorithms. It is strcutred but also encorages creativity and exploration.
            Written fully in python. Also has a version that can be intigrated with gymnasium.

        <th>Weaknesses</th>
        <td>
            The main weakness will include the fact that the assignment cannot be auto graded easily.
            It also expects a good background in python and its related modules.

    <tr>
        <th>Dependencies</th>
        <td>
            A solid background in Python programming is recommended. The assignment is compatible with Python 3+ and can be executed on most single-board computers, ensuring accessibility across various platforms.
            The gymnasium version of the assignment too is fully compatible with python 3.9 +

        <th>Variants</th>
        <td>
            This assignment is adaptable. The presented version is a general version that focuses on all the aspects.
            But below are a few modifications that can be used to focus on a specific task.

            Compare the performence based on the starting values in the Q-Table. (Exploration v/s Exploitation)
            Comapre policy gradiant methods with Q-learning.
            Etc.
